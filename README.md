Our project is a Community Platform for Adopting Stray Animals, designed to connect pet enthusiasts with stray animals in need of loving homes. It offers a comprehensive suite of features, including a Social Media Platform for Pets where users can create profiles for their beloved companions and share photos, videos, and updates. Additionally, the platform provides an Adoption Section where users can post information about stray dogs, facilitating awareness and adoption processes. Through scheduling medical checkups, and community engagement features, our platform aims to streamline the adoption journey and foster a supportive community environment. This project is for pet lovers, animal welfare advocates, and anyone interested in making a positive impact on the lives of stray animals.
